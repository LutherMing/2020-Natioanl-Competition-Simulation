### Restatement of the Problem

#### Problem Background:
In the context of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack collateral assets, banks base their lending decisions on credit policies, trade bill information, and the influence of upstream and downstream enterprises. They provide loans to strong businesses with stable supply-demand relationships and offer preferential interest rates to high-credit, low-risk companies. Banks assess the credit risk of SMEs based on their strength and reputation before determining loan approval, amount, interest rate, and term.

#### Given Information:
- The bank offers loan amounts in the range of RMB 10,000 to RMB 1 million, annual interest rates between 4% to 15%, and loan terms of 1 year.
- Attached datasets include information on 123 businesses with credit records, 302 businesses without credit records, and statistical data on the relationship between loan rates and customer churn rate for the year 2019.

#### Problem Statement:

1. **Quantitative Risk Analysis for 123 Businesses (Attachment 1):**
